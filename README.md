In todayâ€™s fast-paced digital world, managing tasks efficiently is crucial for both individuals and teams to achieve productivity and meet deadlines. This web-based **Task Management System** is designed to streamline the process of creating, organizing, tracking, and completing tasks. Built using modern web technologies, the system provides an intuitive user interface that supports features such as task assignment, due date tracking, status updates, and prioritization.

The goal of this project is to offer a user-friendly and efficient platform where users can manage their daily work, collaborate with others, and maintain a clear overview of ongoing activities. By automating reminders and enabling real-time updates, the system aims to minimize missed deadlines and improve overall workflow.
